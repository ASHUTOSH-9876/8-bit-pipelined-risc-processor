This project implements an 8-bit RISC processor in Verilog HDL with a 3-stage pipeline architecture (Fetch, Decode, Execute). The design is verified using ModelSim simulation and prepared for synthesis in Xilinx Vivado.

✨ Features
1. 8-bit data path

2. 3-stage pipelining to improve instruction throughput

3. Simple instruction set with ALU operations and register file

4. Waveform simulation and verification in ModelSim

5. Exploration of power and timing optimization techniques

🛠️ Tools Used
1. Xilinx Vivado for synthesis

2. ModelSim for simulation and waveform analysis

📂 Directory Structure
src/ - Verilog source files

sim/ - Testbench and simulation artifacts

docs/ - Design documentation and diagrams

🚀 How to Simulate
Open ModelSim.


Compile all Verilog files from src/ and sim/.

Run the testbench and inspect waveform results.
